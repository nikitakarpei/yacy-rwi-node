# pagescrape — Technical Specification

## Context

`pagescrape` owns the scrape pipeline for a stack. The pipeline accepts a scrape request,
fetches the page content through an operator-supplied proxy, offers it to every corpus, and
carries scrape failures and corpus receipts to the outcome feed for the page.
Scrape requests and page offers pass through NATS JetStream.

## Glossary

* **Page URL** — the URL that identifies the page.
* **Fetch URL** — the URL the service requests the content from. The page URL when the
  request names none.
* **Landed URL** — the URL of the last response of the fetch after all redirects.

## Non-Goals

* Deciding which pages to scrape or when to request the first scrape.
* Discovering links, crawling a site, or applying crawl scope rules.
* Deriving, indexing, or storing corpus values from a page.
* Deciding whether a corpus accepts an offered page.
* Bypassing the configured proxy or enforcing the proxy's egress policy.

## Functional Requirements

* For each valid request, the service SHALL make one fetch, at the fetch URL of the request.
* The service SHALL send every origin request through the configured proxy.
* A fetch SHALL follow redirects, but no more hops than the configuration permits.
* A fetch SHALL fail as `redirects-exhausted` when it uses all the hops, or when the
  redirects come back to a URL it fetched before.
* A redirect SHALL NOT change the page URL that identifies the offered page.
* A fetch that succeeds SHALL offer the page one time. The offer carries the page URL, the
  landed URL, the content type, the content, and all `X-Robots-Tag` values.
* A fetch that does not succeed SHALL put one last failure on the outcome feed for the page.
  The origin can refuse the page, reject it, report no change, send too much data, or name
  an invalid redirect target.
* The service SHALL defer the scrape when the origin answers `429` or `503`. It SHALL wait
  for the time in `Retry-After`, or one minute when that time is absent or unreadable.
* The service SHALL scrape a deferred request again, until it succeeds or until the
  configured deferral window ends.
* A request that forbids deferral SHALL fail as soon as the origin defers it.
* A request SHALL stay pending when the broker does not accept its offered page or its
  deferral.
* The service SHALL NOT discard a request it cannot decode.
* The outcome feed SHALL tell which corpus kept the page and which corpus rejected it.
* At startup, the service SHALL create the scrape request stream and the page offer stream
  with the configured retention limits.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* The service SHALL stop an origin fetch that goes past its deadline or its size limit.
* The service SHALL limit how many requests it takes at the same time, and how many stay
  unacknowledged.
* Pending and deferred requests SHALL stay after a service restart, within the configured
  retention limits.
* Instances that share a durable consumer name SHALL divide the requests. Each request SHALL
  go to one instance only.
* The service SHALL supply scrape request and outcome announcement metrics over HTTP.

## Known Limitations

* The outcome feed is not durable. A listener that is away when an outcome is sent does not
  receive it later.
* Outcomes are keyed by page URL, not by request. When two requests for the same page URL
  run together, a listener cannot tell which request made an outcome.
* The service does not publish one outcome that says every corpus has finished.
* The broker does not retain a page offer when no corpus consumer has interest in it.
* A request the service cannot decode stops intake until an operator resolves it.
* An outcome announcement can be lost if publication fails after the request is complete.
* A transient origin failure has the reason `no-reason-given`. It carries no cause.
